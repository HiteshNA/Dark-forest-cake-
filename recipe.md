whisking eggs and sugar 

Bring water to boil in a vessel and then simmer. Double boil the egg + sugar mixture over the vessel of simmering water, whisking constantly. Continue until the egg + sugar mixture is lukewarm (about 3-5 minutes). If you do not stir continously, you will end up with scrambled eggs, so stir continuously. Make sure the egg mixture is lukewarm.

Remove from heat and transfer to a mixing bowl.

Beat on high speed using an electric beater for approximately 5 minutes until the mixture is thick.

Preparing the cherries

While the cake is baking, we will prepare the cherries. I have used Premium Dara Red cherries.

Drain the cherries. Reserve the liquid. This is the cherry syrup. Discard the seeds and the stalk of the cherries and chop it. Keep it aside. Reserve some cherries with the stalk for final decoration. Our cherries are also ready.

Preparation of the whipping cream 
I used three 50 gram packets of Blue Bird whipped cream powder. If you use any other brand, follow the instructions on the packet. Before preparing the whipping cream, chill the bowl and the whisk in the refrigerator for 10 mins.
Place the chilled bowl in which you are going to prepare the whipped cream over a bowl of ice cold water.
Add the whipped cream powder into the chilled bowl.

Beat the mixture with an electric hand mixer for 3 minutes at high speed just until stiff peaks. Do not over beat as it might turn into butter.

Note – In case the whipped cream has softened while decorating the cake, you can refrigerate it for sometime and then use it.
Cake flour – One cup sifted cake flour (100 grams) can be substituted with 3/4 cup (85 grams) sifted all-purpose flour plus 2 tablespoons (15 grams) cornstarch. We have used only 60 grams of this cake flour for making this chocolate genoise/cake.

Chocolate Shavings – Keep the chocolate bar outside the refrigerator for half an hour. Using a vegetable peeler, peel the chocolate to get chocolates shavings and keep it in the refrigerator for it to harden. Decorate cake with it. 


Storage and Shelf life – Cake should be stored in the refrigerator and it keeps well for 2 days.
